# Hangman Game

Created with React and bootstrapped with Vite, deployed [here](https://philip-avdey-hangman-game.netlify.app/) at Netlify. This is a simple website/app to practice. Implemented using TypeScript and SCSS, as well as Framer Motion for various animations. Allows you to play a game of hangman with a list of randomly generated words taken from the most most used words in the English language.
